AndroidDeveloperWorkflow
========================

Alfred (http://alfredapp.com) plays a vital role in my workspace. It helps me get a lot of tasks done out of the box, and allows me to customize it to fit my exact needs. As an Android Developer, there are several minor things that I have set it up to do that I wanted to share with everyone. This workflow is built on top of the Stack Overflow Workflow that I found over here: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/10/25/hidden-productivity-secrets-with-alfred/

##Stack Overflow Search
- st {query}
Like the original Stack Overflow workflow mentioned above, you can get search results for Stack Overflow on Alfred itself

- so {query]
Similar to above command, but limits search to [android]

##Android SDK Search
- ad {query]
Opens a browser tab to the Android developer documentation page for search result to your query

##Gradle Please
- gradle {query}
Opens a browser tab and takes you to gradleplease.appspot.com, where it attempts to find you the library you are looking for and the code you need to paste in your build.gradle file for the repository.

##Asset Studio
- asset studio
Opens a browser tabe to http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/

##ADB
- adb {command}
Allows you to perform adb terminal commands
